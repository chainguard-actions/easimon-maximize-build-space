## Findings Fixed

### script-injection (severity: high)

The 'Maximize build disk space' step in action.yml directly interpolates multiple `${{ inputs.* }}` expressions inside `run:` shell commands without first assigning them to environment variables. Affected inputs include: `inputs.build-mount-path` (used in shell variable assignment and sudo commands), `inputs.root-reserve-mb` / `inputs.temp-reserve-mb` / `inputs.swap-size-mb` (used in `expr` arithmetic), `inputs.pv-loop-path` / `inputs.tmp-pv-loop-path` (used as file path arguments to `sudo touch`, `fallocate`, `losetup`), `inputs.remove-dotnet` / `inputs.remove-android` / `inputs.remove-haskell` / `inputs.remove-codeql` / `inputs.remove-docker-images` (used in `if [[ ${{ inputs.* }} == 'true' ]]` conditionals), `inputs.overprovision-lvm` (used in `if [[ ${{ inputs.overprovision-lvm }} == 'true' ]]`), and `inputs.build-mount-path-ownership` (used in `sudo chown -R`). An attacker who controls these inputs can inject arbitrary shell commands. All inputs should be assigned to environment variables via `env:` and referenced as `$VAR` in the shell script.

## Iteration Notes

### Iteration 1

**Fixes applied:** script-injection, static-inline-injection

**Notes:**

Fixed all 29 script injection findings in action.yml by adding an `env:` block to the 'Maximize build disk space' step. All 13 `${{ inputs.* }}` expressions (build-mount-path, build-mount-path-ownership, root-reserve-mb, temp-reserve-mb, swap-size-mb, overprovision-lvm, pv-loop-path, tmp-pv-loop-path, remove-dotnet, remove-android, remove-haskell, remove-codeql, remove-docker-images) were moved from the `run:` block into the `env:` block as INPUT_* environment variables. The shell script now references these via `${INPUT_*}` variable syntax instead of directly interpolating GitHub Actions expressions, preventing shell injection attacks.
